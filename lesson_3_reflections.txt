When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  i would want to use a remote repository 
  ->   when i working along with some other collaborators.
  ->   when i want to share the repository with others .
  ->   when i am working at a project from different machines .
  ->   when i want to keep online as a backup .
